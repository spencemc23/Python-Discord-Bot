# Python-Discord-Bot
Made for fun, still adding shit. 
To actually run this, you must have installed 'discord.py'

Another helpful thing is that you can run your bot on a program called 'Heroku', this is what I do, and essentially what it means is that you don't have to have your PC turned on while running the program, it runs off a server somewhere in the world, if you're in Australia like me then you will probably have to use the US servers.
